<h3>API Proposal</h3>
<p>
A conf_functions.php will check $_REQUEST data to see which functions are being called and acts accordingly.</br>
Each function will have a 'flag' and extra parameters (depending on the function e.g viewer id)</br>
Each description below may reference any of the following variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>user id</li>
<li>viewer id</li>
<li>ip address (authorization)</li>
<li>site shortname</li>
</ul>
</br>
<u>0.Request a list of users hosted by a particular site.</u></br>
<pre>returns shortname, then id and name of users (may be delimited)</pre>
<button type="button" onclick="users()">users</button></br>
<div id="ret_users"></div>

</br>
<u>1.Request the public profile for a member of a particular site.</u></br>
<pre>selecting a certain user id will return user profile without checking viewer's friendship</pre>


</br>
<u>2.Request the private profile for a member of the particular site.</u></br>
<pre>check viewer's friendship and confirm that 
viewer ip address is consistent (authorization) before returning private profile</pre>
</br>
<u>3.Request a valid URL to retrieve a profile image for a designated user.</u></br>
<pre>return the link to profile image of user id</pre>
</br>
<u>4.Request a complete list of friends for a designated user.</u></br>
<pre>returns list of friends of user id (may be delimited)</pre>
</br>
<u>5.Request a complete list of messages sent or received for a designated user.</u></br>
<pre>check viewer's friendship and confirm that
viewer ip address is consistent (authorization) before returning formatted list of messages
including timestamps, to user id and from user id</pre>
</br>
<u>6.Send (post) a new message from a designated user logged into the current site to another user who is a friend.</u></br>
</br>
<pre>check viewer's friendship and confirm that
viewer ip address is consistent (authorization) before returning a form in which 
viewer can $_POST to user id
</pre>
</br>
<u>8.Initiate a friend request to a particular site and site member.</u></br>
</br>
<pre>
check viewer's friendship (or lack thereof in this case) and confirm that 
viewer ip address is consistent (authorization) before using a $_POST request
</pre>
</br>
<u>9.Confirm (accept) a friend request sent by user A to user B, probably on different sties.</u></br>
<pre>
check viewer's friendship (or lack thereof in this case) and confirm that 
viewer ip address is consistent (authorization) before handling the $_POST 
</pre>
